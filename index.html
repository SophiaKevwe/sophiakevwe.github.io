Building on a solid background in Data Science, I apply sophisticated methods in Machine Learning, NLP, and Clustering, alongside skills in Python programming, SQL database management, and data visualization with tools like Power BI, to display patterns and predictions that matter. I am continuously learning and evolving, currently deepening my expertise through a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence Engineering. My work reflects a commitment to excellence, supported by a track record of successful projects that showcase my ability to solve problems and communicate insights effectively. Explore my portfolio to see how I apply data science to real-world challenges, and feel free to connect with me to discuss the future of technology using data.
